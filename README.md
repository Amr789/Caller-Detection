# Caller-Detection
Detecting Caller's telephone number

This project aims to create a system for a small company to track employees' phone usage. The system, attached non-destructively to the existing phone line, will identify dialed numbers. It must work with the company's DTMF dialing system and not interfere with other signals, like ADSL. The system includes a filtering circuit and Arduino code for signal analysis, ensuring accurate identification of dialed numbers.
